How to Run the software:

The software allos 2 distint simulation modes: fixed event Number or time acquisition.

- Fixed event number mode:
	./MultipleFibbers (string)file.mac (int)RunNumber int(Nevents)
	
	Input parameters:
		file.mac:
			if provided the simulation will run without visualization
			if "0" the software will run with visualization
		RunNumber
			Insert the RunNumber. Important for the time acquisitonMode. see below
		Nevents
			Insert the number of events to Run. If "0" the time acquisitionmode will be selected.

- Time acquisition mode:
	./MultipleFibbers (string)file.mac (int)RunNumber 0 (int)acquisitionTime_s (int)sourceActivityBq/L
	
	Input parameters:
		file.mac:
			Same as before
		RunNumber
			Insert the RunNumber. The time for each event will be incremented by RunNumber*acquisitionTime
		Nevents
			Must be "0". Otherelse the fixed event number mode will be selected.
		AcquisitionTime_s:
			The acquistion time em seconds
		sourceActivityBq/L:
			The source activity in Bq/L. The software considers the activity as constant during the Runs.
